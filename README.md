# MGVU
Metagen Global Virtual University
(The University in the Metaverse)

Technology education will be the great equalizer between the rich and the poor in the future.  MGVU is shaping a future where technology education is inclusive, accessible, democratized, and decentralized.     

MGVU offers an online bachelor’s and master’s degree in digital Transformation.  It intends to be a plugin for accredited universities worldwide to offer the highest technology education to provide students a competitive edge in the workforce or prepare them to launch their tech own startups.
The program is available to any accredited universities interested in offering bachelor’s and master’s degree programs focused on advanced technology and digital transformation.

The program can be self-paced, or instructor driven.  The MGVU app (available in iOS, Android, and or any browser) is the portal to access all courseware and resources to complete the program.  Students can download a course and learn at their own pace or attend the scheduled-live classes (offered through Zoom/MS Teams or the Metaverse using a Virtual Reality platform) or both.  
We offer top-quality technology education by recruiting professors coming from Ivy League schools like Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and others.  All our professors and instructors have Ph.D. or Master’s degrees to guarantee the quality of our curriculum.  

To Graduate with:

Bachelor of Science in Digital Transformation
A student must complete 30 courseware, pass three professional certifications, and complete three capstone projects. 

and

Master of Science in Digital Transformation

A student must complete ten additional courseware, pass three other professional certifications, and complete a thesis paper.  

Partnership Model

As a partner host university, you can charge whatever standard fee you typically charge your students per credit unit; then, we split it 50/50.  Half goes to the partner university and half to MGVU (to pay professors, administrators, and the platform’s maintenance).  If you are a state university and do not charge for anything to your students, we won’t charge anything either -- this is how we enforce the STFS (Socialized Tuition Fee System).  With STFS, students can apply at any local state university and enjoy the same quality education as those in Ivy League schools MGVU program.  Students all over the world coming from Harvard-MGVU, University of the Philippines-MGVU, Local State University-MGVU, and anywhere will converge in the same class, get the same quality education, from the same professors -- but paid their tuitions depending on their socio-economic capacity.   


Why enroll for a Bachelor’s or Master’s in Digital Transformation?

A degree is becoming less and less critical today.  Most organizations seek individuals who can demonstrate real-life skills, expertise, and knowledge.  Companies are looking for people who can perform a job effectively rather than a diploma from an Ivy League school. Nowadays, in more prominent tech companies, your aptitude test is usually a coding or programming exam to solve a given problem.  Professional certifications with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Cisco, CISM (Certified Information Security Manager), CISSP (Certified Information Security Professional), PMP (Project Management Professional), ITIL (IT Information Library), and other professional IT certification programs are also becoming more relevant; as they can show mastery of a specific platform or system, and not just basic theories.  So, guiding our students in obtaining professional IT certifications is vital in our program.  

To graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Digital Transformation at MGVU, one must complete 30 courseware, pass at least three professional certifications, and demonstrate mastery of each program by fulfilling three capstone projects.  

Then to pursue the Master’s in Digital Transformation degree program, one must take ten additional courses, pass another three professional IT certifications, and write an original thesis paper of at least 100 pages.


The MGVU Way
 
MGVU brings immersive quality education through a self-paced or instructor-led class in the Metaverse.  Our mission is to bring egalitarian and equitable quality education to students anywhere in the world.  We offer full scholarships to qualified students in underserved countries and communities.  We aim to train the next generations to acquire real-life mastery of 4th Transformational Technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, Web 3.0 development, Cloud Computing, Metaverse technologies (such as Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Extended Reality, and Mixed Reality), including games development and cybersecurity.  We want to bring an immersive learning experience at the convenience of our students’ homes.  We partner with top educational institutions like Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and many top-caliber schools worldwide.  We aim to provide state-of-the-art courseware to hone the mastery of 4th Transformational technologies; demonstrated by passing at least three professional certifications for our bachelor’s program and another three professional certifications for our master’s program.   

Leveraging 4th Transformational Technologies
(AI, IoT, W3, Cloud, DLT, and the Metaverse)
 
The world is becoming more intelligent and interconnected thanks to Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things.  We now have intelligent machines that can talk, see, hear, and think unprecedentedly -- evolving and updating themselves constantly.  Topics such as NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Computer Vision through an Artificial Neural Network are critical success factors in honing one’s mastery of AI.  These intelligent machines, robots, and devices are now ever-present in our workplaces and home.  Who doesn’t have Alexa, Google, Cortana, Siri, and Bixby in their lives?  

Industry 4.0, self-driving cars, telemetry, remote sensing, and a vast array of IoT implementations are essential topics to understand the design, architecture, and roadmap of the connected world into the future.  With over 30 billion connected devices over the Internet, mastery of connecting, managing, and protecting these devices and our data privacy has become more critical than ever.  At MGVU, we overlay our courses with cybersecurity as this is critical and essential towards securing our interconnected-intelligent-digital world, and what else offers the best security than cipher technology itself — blockchain.  With blockchain, we can guarantee the immutability of transactions over Web 3 and vast blockchain projects to help decentralize traditional systems, processes, and organizations.  
We deliver and provide all our courses virtually through 2D channels like Zoom, Google Meeting, or MS Teams -- and/or VR-based learning platforms using Metaverse (i.e., Spatial or FrameVR).  Students can access our courses anywhere and anytime via smartphones, tablets, computers, cheap single-board computers (like a Raspberry Pi), and for a more immersive experience – a VR headset.

What is AIoT?

AIoT combines Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things to achieve enhanced operations, human-machine interactions, and advanced analytics.  It aims to create smart systems, transform industries, and enable new business models or applications to perform intelligent tasks with minimal human intervention.

What is Web 3.0?

Web 3.0 refers to the next generation of the World Wide Web that aims to make data more interconnected, intelligent, and intuitive for machines and humans.  It includes using technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, the Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain to create a more integrated, seamless, and private web experience.

Decentralized Ledger Technologies & Blockchain

DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) encompasses various technologies that record and validate transactions in a decentralized and distributed manner.  Blockchain is a specific type of DLT that uses a chain of blocks to store and validate transactions.  In a blockchain, each block contains a set of timestamped transactions linked to the previous block, creating chains of records or blocks that form the immutable ledger.  Blockchain records cannot be altered or deleted.  Blockchain is behind Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts, and NFTs (Non-fungible tokens), and a growing ecosystem. 
 
What is the Metaverse?

The Metaverse is a concept that refers to a virtual shared space created by the convergence of multiple virtual reality environments, augmented reality, and other immersive technologies.  In the Metaverse, users can interact with each other and the virtual environment in real time, creating a fully immersive and interactive experience.  At MGVU, we believe that the Metaverse is the future of the academe, that will provide the highest-quality technology degrees to prepare students to be ready for the real world.

What else can you get from Metagen Metaversity?

Braincubation Start-up Sharktank (for the Digital Entrepreneurs of the Future)

If a student feels that their capstone project is worthy for a Kickstarter or Shark Tank, we’ll offer them to pitch to our VCs and Angel Investors using Braincubation's (http://www.braincubation.com) platform.  Selected braincubated projects will be presented at Harvard's I-lab.
Before the pitch, we will offer candidates a blatant review of their idea, then show them some tips on how to successfully pitch their projects if they are worthy.  
 
Placement service for those who seek stability.

After graduation, we will not just let our graduates out to dry; MGVU will help them to seek employment free of charge, either full-time or contractual.  We want to make sure that our graduates make good use of their talents and skills.  In return, we'll ask their employers to support the MGVU program to be our sponsors or benefactors.  
 

Performance Rating and Continuous Development

We will keep track of our graduates’ development and survey their employers to rate their job performance, for two main reasons:

1.  Performance assessment - to guide them in achieving peak performance consistently.  If we detect any development opportunities, we'll recommend other courses to help them develop further.
2.  Determine the right compensation level - compensation usually depends on one’s skillset, experience, and passion -- which translates to one’s overall performance.  Typically, the better rates you get from your employer, the higher your expertise level, and therefore, the higher compensation levels you can command.

Continuing Education

As one embarks on professional life, oftentimes, technical training and expertise may not be sufficient to get one to the next level of growth in their chosen career to be promoted.  Of course, this doesn't mean that one cannot grow as an AI or IoT developer, W3 programmer, VR/AR developer, or entrepreneur by focusing one’s energy on technical expertise.  However, developing other essential business, managerial, and relationship skills to complement technical savviness is often the key to employment or business success, so we offer the Digital Transformation Master’s Program.  

The concentration of the Digital Transformation Master's Program is to help technical professionals thrive as managers and leaders.  It focuses on IT Business Relationship Management, Project Management, Organizational Leadership, Lean Six Sigma, Mastering ITIL, Financial accounting, Entrepreneurship, Business Oral and Written Communications, Writing Whitepapers, and Negotiations. 

Fee and Matriculation:  Socialized Tuition System (STS)

By plugging the MGVU system into any accredited universities program, we can guarantee that the cost of tuition and other fees is scaled based on the student's economic capacity to pay. The lower the family's income, the lower the tuition and fees they are required to pay. The only determining factor is the partner school’s tuition fee scale.  The courseware, the professors, and everything else is the same.    

Qualified students can graduate from our programs without spending a dime.  Also, the Metagen DAO and other corporate sponsors will provide the Raspberry Pi single-board computer devices to those who can't afford a computer or a smart phone.  

Our programs aim to help level off the playing field between those who can afford expensive Ivy League education versus some poor kids in the underserved communities from 3rd and 4th world countries.  While our base programs are free from edX from top-brass universities such as Harvard, Stanford, and MIT, our degree courses require our students to do community service, as part of the developing keystone habits and inculcating discipline.  Proof of Community Service is tracked using the MGVU app. Becoming a student assistant is another way to get a full scholarship in the program.
